Our hobbies and interests help us learn and grow to become better at what we do, even when they seem somewhat unrelated. Pick a keystone habit to keep creativity juices flowing.

Working on more than one project at a time makes us more creative. [Multiple side projects yields creativity](multiple-side-projects-yields-creativity).

Do work you can't resist and see where your passions take you. It will lead to serendipitous innovation.

> “If you’re struggling to make progress with your side projects, give up. They’re not for you. The best work – in my opinion – comes naturally, and comes from the heart. It’s a gut instinct to want to make stuff. You shouldn’t need to motivate yourself to do this stuff: it should be a passion; a thing that you feel you just have to make.“ — Mr Bingo
