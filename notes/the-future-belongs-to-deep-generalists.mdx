Versatility is valuable. Narrow specialisation suppresses creative thinking and problem-solving abilities.

A deep generalist is someone who generalises but does it deeply, with a balance of knowledge depth and knowledge breadth. They adapt well and turn change into opportunities.

Many great thinkers are generalising specialists. Most of humankind's significant breakthroughs come from multi-faceted individuals. Famous deep generalists include Shakespeare, Leonardo Da Vinci, Benjamin Franklin, Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, and Marie Curie.

Is there a middle ground between generalists and specialists? Every day, we have to decide where to invest our time — do we become better at what we do or learn something new?[^s1]

  - “The challenge we all face is how to maintain the benefits of breadth, diverse experience, interdisciplinary thinking, and delayed concentration in a world that increasingly incentivizes, even demands, hyperspecialization”
  - “The precise person you are now is fleeting, just like all the other people you’ve been. That feels like the most unexpected result, but it is also the most well documented.”
  - “it is difficult to accept that the best learning road is slow, and that doing poorly now is essential for better performance later. It is so deeply counterintuitive that it fools the learners themselves."
