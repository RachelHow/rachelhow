Creativity begins with a clear mind. A clear mind means clear thinking.

How to have clear thinking? Write. Write as much as you can. [Quantity leads to quality](quantity-leads-to-quality).

Think of writing as a way to exercise your creative muscles. When you write, you learn and discover ideas, not the other way around. Writing untangles the messy thoughts in your head and transforms them into powerful ideas. It keeps the mind engaged and serves as a creative outlet.
