Imagine someone points a gun to your head right now and says, _'Achieve your goal by next month or die.'_

What would you do first?

Would you still do what you're doing today?

Would you still make the same decisions as before?

> "A simple question that can deliver powerful results if taken seriously: What is the highest leverage action I can execute on right now?" â€” [James Clear](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1330523876099493888?s=20)

If you want to be an entrepreneur, instead of reading endless books and over-strategizing business plans, go ship something and learn in the process of making it happen. _Or you'll die._

When you're overwhelmed and need to prioritize, ask yourself this simple question: **'What's the highest leverage action I can do now?'**

Maybe checking everything on your to-do list is not one of them. Maybe taking yet another online course will not help you get closer to where you need to be. Maybe... you've already done enough research.

You're ready. You simply need to execute the highest leverage action. Now, go execute. _Or you'll die._

Love,
